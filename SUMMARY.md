# Implementation Summary: Event-Driven Account and Transaction Services

## Overview
We've implemented a fully event-driven architecture for the communication between the Balance Service and Transaction Service. The implementation follows the CloudEvents specification for standardized event messaging and incorporates local caching to improve performance and resilience.

## Balance Service Enhancements

### 1. Account Lifecycle Events
- **AccountCreatedEvent**: Published when a new account is created
- **AccountUpdatedEvent**: Published when an account's details or balance are updated
- **AccountClosedEvent**: Published when an account is closed

### 2. New API Endpoints
- **Update Account Owner**: `PUT /accounts/{id}/owner`
- **Update Account Balance**: `PUT /accounts/{id}/balance`
- **Close Account**: `POST /accounts/{id}/close`
- **Get All Accounts**: `GET /accounts`

### 3. Enhanced Domain Model
- Added support for account closure with a `closed` flag
- Added appropriate exception classes for error handling
- Improved validation to prevent operations on closed accounts

### 4. Transactional Event Publishing
- All database operations and event publishing happen within the same transaction
- Ensures data consistency between state changes and events

## Transaction Service Enhancements

### 1. Local Account Cache
- Implemented `AccountCache` entity to store a local copy of account data
- Maintained through events received from the Balance Service
- Reduces dependencies on synchronous API calls

### 2. Event Consumer
- Created handlers for all account-related events
- Updates local cache based on received events
- Automatically handles account creation, updates, and closures

### 3. Improved Account Validation
- First tries to validate using local cache for better performance
- Falls back to API call if account not found in cache
- Prevents transactions on closed accounts

### 4. Resilient Design
- Reduced coupling between services
- Transaction Service can operate with degraded functionality if Balance Service is unavailable
- Centralized logging for better observability

## Benefits of This Implementation

### Business Benefits
1. **Improved User Experience**: Faster transaction processing with local validation
2. **Enhanced Consistency**: All services maintain consistent views of accounts
3. **Better Business Rules**: Can prevent transactions on closed accounts

### Technical Benefits
1. **Reduced Coupling**: Services communicate primarily through events
2. **Improved Resilience**: Can continue operating if other services are temporarily unavailable
3. **Better Scalability**: Services can scale independently
4. **Future-Proofing**: New services can consume existing events without modifying publishers

## Testing the Implementation

The implementation can be tested using the provided Postman collection, which includes requests for:
1. Creating accounts
2. Updating account details
3. Closing accounts
4. Creating transactions
5. Viewing transaction details

## Next Steps

Potential future improvements include:
1. Adding event versioning for schema evolution
2. Implementing event replay for rebuilding the account cache if needed
3. Adding metrics and monitoring for event processing
4. Implementing saga patterns for complex operations that span multiple services
